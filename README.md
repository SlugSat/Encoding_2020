# Encoding_2020

This repository holds code for encoding and decoding data

The purpose of the type of encoding implemented in this repository (channel coding) is to keep the integrity of data in the face of random bit error. Random errors could occur randomly in a number or in sequence(Burst errors). The implemented code (BCH) should be capable of handling both case provided that the amounts of errors is within the error detecting and error correcting capabilities of the implementation.
